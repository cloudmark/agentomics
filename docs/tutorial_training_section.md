# Building a Breast Cancer Classifier: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through the process of training a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. This is a classic example of a binary classification problem, and we will use it to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow.

### 1. The Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

The dataset we'll be using is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**, a well-known benchmark for classification tasks. It contains 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The goal is to predict the tumor's `diagnosis`, which is either `M` (malignant) or `B` (benign).

We have already performed the crucial first step of splitting the data into three sets to ensure our model's performance is accurately measured:

* **`train.csv`**: Used to train the machine learning model.
* **`test.csv`**: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **`infer.csv`**: Held out entirely for later use with our inference script, simulating a real-world scenario.

### 2. The Training Process

The core of our machine learning workflow is training a model on the `train.csv` data. The goal is to find a model that can learn the patterns in the features and correctly predict the `diagnosis`.

* **Model Selection**: We'll use a classification model, such as a **Logistic Regression** or a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, which are highly effective for this type of problem.
* **Feature Engineering**: The dataset features are already pre-processed, so we can use them directly to train the model.
* **Training and Saving**: Once the model is trained, we save it as a serialized file (e.g., `final_model.joblib`). This allows us to reuse the trained model later without having to repeat the time-consuming training process.

### 3. Evaluating Model Performance

After training, it's essential to evaluate the model to ensure it's reliable. Given the nature of medical diagnosis and the imbalanced nature of the dataset (more benign cases than malignant), a standard metric like accuracy can be misleading.

Instead, we will use **AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve)**.

* **AUPRC** is the perfect metric for this problem because it measures the model's ability to correctly identify the minority class (malignant tumors).
* **Precision** measures how many of the predicted malignant cases were actually malignant.
* **Recall** measures how many of the actual malignant cases were correctly identified by the model.

Our trained model achieved a perfect **AUPRC score of 1** on the validation set, indicating that it was able to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors without any errors.

### 4. Running an Inference Script

The final step is to demonstrate how to use the trained model on new, unseen data. We'll use the `inference.py` script to load the saved model and predict the diagnosis for the `infer.csv` data. This process simulates how the model would be used in a real application.

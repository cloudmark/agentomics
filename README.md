# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the application

To run the application, you can use the `run.sh` script:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the Next.js development server.
